/*Reason for var =
Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized. Var is known to exist but hasnâ€™t been assigned a value yet.

R for let =
Variables declared with let (and const) are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. They remain in a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered. Accessing the variable in this zone causes a ReferenceError.*/
